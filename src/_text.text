q2. How to validate React props using PropTypes
ans: A parent component passes data with props to their child component because props are like HTML attributes but they can contain dynamic data. If we pass in prop values that donâ€™t match the type specified, we get an error. Therefore, validating react props is necessary.
They can be validated by setting the proptypes property of the Foocomponent to an object that has the names of the props  to validate as the keys. And the corresponding values are the data type of the props.
